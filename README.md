# PRG2 - Simple JavaFX Client for Movies
[![prog2 pipeline](https://github.com/sofakonig/Prog2/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sofakonig/Prog2/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

This exercise demonstrates how to build a **JavaFX** application that retrieves and displays movie data from a REST API. You’ll practice:

- Making HTTP calls (e.g., using Java’s `OkHttp`)
- Parsing JSON responses (e.g., with Gson)
- Building a basic UI with JavaFX (e.g., a text field, a search button, and a results list)

## Requirements

- **Java 17** (or higher)
- **JavaFX**
- A **public movie API** (e.g., [OMDb](https://www.omdbapi.com/) or [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3))
- **Maven** for dependency management

## Setup & How to Run

1. **Clone or Download** this project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-movie-client.git
